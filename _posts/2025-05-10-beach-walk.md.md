   Under the soft morning mist, I wandered along the rugged coastline, where the air was thick with the scent of salt and seaweed. The rhythmic crash of waves provided a soothing backdrop as I observed a flock of gulls soaring overhead, their calls echoing across the shore. I collected a handful of seashells, each uniquely shaped by the ocean’s touch, and sketched a few in my notebook. The interplay of light on the water and the distant silhouette of a lighthouse inspired a moment of quiet reflection.

   The tide pools were alive with small crabs scuttling among the rocks, and I noted a few anemones clinging to the surfaces. This walk reminded me of nature’s ability to both calm and invigorate the spirit.
