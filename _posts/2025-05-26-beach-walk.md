Beach Walk at Sunset Cove, May 2025

May 26, 2025

On today’s solitary walk along Sunset Cove, the beach was alive with the rhythm of the tides. The sand was strewn with kelp and polished shells, their surfaces catching the late afternoon light. In a tidepool, I spotted a cluster of sea anemones, their tentacles swaying gently in the shallow water. Sketched their shapes in my notebook and took a photo for reference.

A flock of sandpipers darted along the shoreline, their quick steps leaving delicate tracks. The air carried the sharp scent of salt and seaweed, grounding me in the moment.



Reflections: The vastness of the ocean always feels humbling, yet the small details—like the anemones’ slow dance—remind me how much life thrives in every corner. I want to learn more about the local seabird migration patterns.
