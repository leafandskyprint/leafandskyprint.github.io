Beach Walk at Sunset Cove, May 2025

May 26, 2025

On today’s solitary walk along Sunset Cove, the beach was alive with the rhythm of the tides. The sand was strewn with kelp and polished shells, their surfaces catching the late afternoon light. In a tidepool, I spotted a cluster of sea anemones, their tentacles swaying gently in the shallow water. Sketched their shapes in my notebook using a pencil, planning to digitize them in Inkscape later.

A flock of sandpipers darted along the shoreline, their quick steps leaving delicate tracks. The air carried the sharp scent of salt and seaweed, grounding me in the moment.



Reflections: The vastness of the ocean feels humbling, yet the small details—like the anemones’ slow dance—remind me how much life thrives in every corner. I’m curious about the local seabird migration patterns and plan to research more.
